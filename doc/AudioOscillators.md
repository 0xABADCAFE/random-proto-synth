# Fundamentals > Oscillators > Audio

## Background

Audio _Oscillators_ are the fundamental building blocks of sound generation. An _Oscillator_ takes a _Generator_ and uses it to produce a stream of audio at a given frequenency. In addition to this, _Oscillators_ permit the frequency to be modified from some _Control Signal_ source and the phase to be modulated from some other _Audio Signal_ source, providing the fundamentals necessary for FM synthesis.
